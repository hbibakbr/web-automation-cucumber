This is a personal project focused on practicing functional web automation testing on the Saucedemo website using WebdriverIO with Cucumber. The goal of this project is to enhance skills in End-to-End (E2E) testing, covering critical user workflows such as login, adding a product to the cart, accessing the cart page, and completing the checkout process. The project leverages **Cucumber** for structuring the test scenarios in Gherkin syntax, **spec-reporter** for clear and readable test reporting, and **chromedriver** to run the tests in the Chrome browser.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project scenarios include:

- **Login.feature**: Automate scenario of the login process with valid user credentials and the negative flow.
- **Add to Cart**: Automate scenario of add product to the shopping cart.
- **Checkout**: Scenario of Completing the checkout process, which includes entering user information, validating the order summary, and finish an order.
